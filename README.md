# Paideia

**Paideia** is an open-source platform that helps you turn your notes into flashcards using AI, and reminds you to restudy them using spaced repetition. You control your data and your AI: bring your own API key, and Paideia will never lock you in or charge you for usage.

- 🔒 **Open Source & Self-Hostable**: 100% open-source, no vendor lock-in, no hidden fees.
