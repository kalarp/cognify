# Cognify

**Cognify** is an open-source platform that helps you turn your notes into flashcards using AI, and reminds you to restudy them using spaced repetition. You control your data and your AI: bring your own API key.

## Features

- ✨ **AI-Powered Flashcard Generation**: Automatically extract key concepts from your notes and generate targeted flashcards.
- 📄 **Multiple Input Formats**: Upload text, paste content, or upload PDF files.
- 🗄️ **Personal Study Database**: All flashcards are stored securely for your account.
- 🔑 **Your Own API**: Use your own AI API key (OpenAI, etc.) for privacy and control.
- ⏰ **Spaced Repetition Reminders**: Get reminders to review your flashcards for optimal learning.
- 🔒 **Open Source & Self-Hostable**: 100% open-source, no vendor lock-in, no hidden fees.
- 🛡️ **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up, login, and user management.
- 🖼️ **User Profiles**: Upload profile pictures, change usernames, and manage your account.
- 🌐 **OAuth Support**: Sign in with Google, GitHub, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (for package management)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account (for authentication and database)
- An AI API key (e.g., OpenAI). You can also test with a local model using LMStudio or any other local AI (not recommended for actually creating flashcards)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/chaosweasl/cognify.git
   cd cognify
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   # Or set to your deployed URL if not running locally
   # Add your AI API key as needed
   ```

   > **Note:**  
   > Do **not** use `https://cognify-chaosweasl.vercel.app` unless you are deploying to the official instance.  
   > Use your own local or deployment URL for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. **Update Supabase Authentication Settings:**

   In your [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project dashboard, go to **Authentication → URL Configuration**.  
   Set the **Site URL** to `http://localhost:3000` (or the URL you use for local testing).  
   This ensures authentication redirects work correctly during development.

6. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.**
