# Contributing to Cognify

Welcome contributions! Please read the following guidelines to get started.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix (do not commit directly to `main`).
3. Install dependencies if you haven't already.
4. Set up your own `.env.local`: Use your own Supabase project credentials and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to your local or deployed URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).  
   **Do not use the official production URL unless you are deploying your own instance.**
5. Make your changes (add features, fix bugs, improve docs).
6. Test your changes locally (if possible, also deploy a preview with Vercel to check for ESLint issues).
7. Commit your changes with clear messages
8. Push to your fork and submit a Pull Request.

## Code Style

- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for formatting and linting.
- Use [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) for UI components.
- Write clear, concise commit messages.
- Keep PRs focused and small when possible.

## Issues & Discussions

- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/chaosweasl/cognify/issues) for bugs and feature requests.
- For questions or ideas, open a [Discussion](https://github.com/chaosweasl/cognify/discussions).

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately.

## Setting Up Supabase for Local Development

To run Cognify locally, you need your own [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project. Here’s how to configure it:

**Recommended:** Use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and Supabase together for the smoothest experience.  
You can link your Supabase project to your Vercel project and automatically pull environment variables using the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli).

### Quick Setup with Vercel + Supabase

1. **Deploy your fork to Vercel**

   - [Import your GitHub repo to Vercel](https://vercel.com/new).
   - During setup, you can link your Supabase project and Vercel will auto-populate your environment variables.

2. **Pull environment variables locally**
   - Install the Vercel CLI:
     ```sh
     npm i -g vercel
     ```
   - Log in and link your project:
     ```sh
     vercel login
     vercel link
     ```
   - Pull your environment variables:
     ```sh
     vercel env pull .env.local
     ```
   - Now your `.env.local` will have the correct Supabase keys and site URL.

### Manual Setup

1. **Create a Supabase project**  
   Go to [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com/) and create a new project.

2. **Get your API keys**

   - In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Project Settings → API**.
   - Copy the **Project URL** and **anon public key**.

3. **Configure authentication redirect URLs**

   - Go to **Authentication → URL Configuration**.
   - Set the **Site URL** to `http://localhost:3000` (or your local dev URL).
   - Add any additional redirect URLs you need (e.g., for Vercel previews).

4. **Update your `.env.local`**

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

5. **(Optional) Enable OAuth providers**

   - In **Authentication → Providers**, enable GitHub or other providers you want to test.
   - Set the callback/redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`.

6. **(Optional) Update password/email settings**
   - In **Authentication → Settings**, you can adjust password requirements, email confirmations, etc., to match your needs.

For more details, see the [Supabase docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth).

## Troubleshooting

### Email confirmation links go to the wrong URL
  Make sure you have set the correct "Site URL" in your Supabase Auth settings. For local development, you may need to temporarily set it to `http://localhost:3000`.

### OAuth not working locally  
  Double-check that your provider callback URLs are set to your local dev URL in Supabase.
